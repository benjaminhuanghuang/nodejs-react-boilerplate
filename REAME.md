## Dependencies
    On server side, we need
        express

    react
    react-dom

## Dev Dependencies
    We use babel to transpile JSX code and ES6 code, so we need
        babel-core
        babel-preset-react
        babel-preset-es2015
    We use webpack to manage the process, so we need
        babel-loader

    webpack-dev-middleware will re-run webpack any time if JavaScript files were changed
